title: CSS dillema - When to use Tailwind CSS and when styled-components
---

CSS is hard. It's so hard I would say that it's the only thing I'm pretty sure I'm bad it. This fueled my constant search for some tool that would help me with CSS composition.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. Meaning it's not providing UI components, but set of utility classes. This is very helpful when building landing pages or just something which looks a bit different than Bootstrap. If you are still unsure read more thought out explanation on [Talwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/).

I tend to use Tailwind when I'm building website like landing page or a blog.


## Styled components

Styled components are go to solution when building some components which might get reused or when injecting components to existing page.
